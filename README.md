> * Output: **writing score**

### Correlation Analysis

Based on Pearson correlation coefficients:

Here is interactions between reading score and writing score:
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/24a92821-6fa4-49c7-844f-bfdf1e24db89)
* `reading score` and `writing score`: **0.947** â€”> very strong positive linear relationship
* `math score` is also positively correlated with both `reading` (0.802) and `writing` (0.778)
* Non-numeric fields like `gender`, `lunch`, and `test preparation course` have weaker correlations with scores (< 0.3)
* The feature `reading score` is a **very good predictor** for `writing score`.

## Method 1: Ternary Search on Mean Squared Error Loss
The equation for cost with one variable is:
We define the hypothesis function as:

$$
f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) = wx^{(i)} + b
$$

The cost function is:

$$
J(w,b) = \frac{1}{2m} \sum_{i = 0}^{m-1} (f_{w,b}(x^{(i)}) - y^{(i)})^2
$$
