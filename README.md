# Linear Regression Optimization: Ternary Search vs Gradient Descent

In this project I will demonstrates and compares two optimization techniques — **Ternary Search** and **Gradient Descent** — for minimizing the **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** in a univariate linear regression model. While both aim to find the optimal parameters that minimize the loss, they differ significantly in their principles, applications, and efficiency.
